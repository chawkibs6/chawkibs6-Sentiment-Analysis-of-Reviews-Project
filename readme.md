2. **Upload Dataset**: Uploads the dataset from Google Colab.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Assigns sentiment labels based on the review ratings.
   - Splits data into training and testing sets.
   - Handles missing values and vectorizes text data.
4. **Train Model**: Uses Naive Bayes classifier to train the model.
5. **Predict and Evaluate**: Evaluates the modelâ€™s performance using classification metrics.
6. **Save Notebook**: Saves the notebook to Google Drive.
